Search by Algolia is the smartest way to improve search on your site. Autocomplete is included, along with full control over look, feel and relevance.

== Description ==

The plugin provides relevant search results in milliseconds, ensuring that your users can find your best posts at the speed of thought. It also comes with native typo-tolerance and is language-agnostic, so that every WordPress user, no matter where they are, can benefit from it.

= About pricing =

This plugin relies on the [Algolia service](https://www.algolia.com/) which requires you to [create an account here](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up).
Algolia offers its Search as a Service provider on a incremental payment program, including a free Hacker Plan which includes 10,000 records & 100,000 operations per month. Beyond that, plans start at $49/month.

Note that there isn’t a direct correlation between the number of posts in WordPress and the number of records in Algolia.
Also note that we only offer support to paying plans.
On average, you can expect to have about 10 times more records than you have posts, though this is not a golden rule and you could end up with more records.

= Getting started guide =
Once you have installed the plugin, you can follow the step by step guide provided here: https://community.algolia.com/wordpress/configuration.html

= Relevance =
Algolia enhances your search functionality with a completely customizable search experience which can be seamlessly integrated into your Wordpress theme. It lets you create a find-as-you-type experience or an auto-complete dropdown menu, which provides relevant results from the first keystroke. Our extension also automatically synchronizes data (posts, taxonomies etc.) in real-time, making sure that any updates to your site are available as soon as they are made.

= Speed =
Algolia returns results in under 35ms on an average – irrespective of whether you have 100s or 1000s of posts.
Our state-of-the-art infrastructure and distributed search network ensures that your readers benefit from this, no matter where they are.

= Accessibility =
Search by Algolia gives you the ability to make all forms of data – blog posts, categories, users etc. – searchable from a single search bar. Algolia also gives you the ability to completely customize your search results based on criteria that makes sense for your business, such as popularity, date, relevance etc.

= Built by developers for developers =
Search by Algolia is also completely configurable and fully extensible by means of WordPress filters and hooks, letting you build a custom search experience or theme based on Algolia.

== Installation ==

* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)

Visit the [Search by Algolia server requirements documentation](https://community.algolia.com/wordpress/installation.html) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Search by Algolia, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Algolia” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our search plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our search plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
