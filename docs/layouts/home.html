    <h1>Dear Algolia X Wordpress users</h1>
    <p>
      After discussing with a lot of you, we've realized that our Wordpress
      plugin, while being easy to implement and use, did not provide the room
      for customization necessary to build satisfying, advanced search and
      discovery experiences on Wordpress websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's why
      <b>we have decided to double down on our new PHP API client instead</b>.
      We created a
      <a
        href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/integration/wordpress/getting-started/quick-start/"
        >comprehensive documentation</a
      >
      to guide you to index your Wordpress content, optimize your relevance, and
      build state-of-the art front end experiences relying on the API client.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe this approach is the most robust, satisfying and future-proof
      way to build great experiences for Wordpress websites.
      <b>We will therefore stop supporting our Wordpress plugin</b> following
      this timeline:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        From <b>05/02/19</b>: we won't add any new feature or fix any new
        functional bug in our Wordpress plugin
      </li>
      <li>
        From <b>31/12/19</b>: we won't provide any security fix to our Wordpress
        plugin
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please note that
      <b
        >if you already have the plugin set up and are satisfied with your
        current integration, you can keep using the plugin forever, knowing that
        it won't be supported</b
      >
      according to the timeline above.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will still work as is, in its current state, on your website. Happy
      coding,
    </p>
